        <h1><em>Project Oasis: The Origin Story</h1></em>
        <p>Project Oasis started out as a far fetched idea to create something meaningful for users in the NFT space. 
            After being in this space for over 2 years now, we have seen various cycles happen. From the fisrt boom with 
            Cryptopunks and BAYC, to the insanse run of Goblintown, to Jack Butchers Checks. We have seen various highs and lows
            in this market but we have stayed in the market together. Why? Is it the potential to create wealth for yourself and
            those around you? Is it for the art? Is it for the community? We all have our reasons for being in this market but connecting
            and watching a project succeed is what keeps us in it. <strong><em>Connection.</strong></em> We as humans need this connection with one another
            in this era of becoming more and more digital. <strong><em>Art.</strong></em> We have shifted the meaning of what art is and how we create it 
            in this digital era. <strong><em>Wealth.</strong></em> We all want some form of wealth whether that be building a name for yourself 
            or being able to provide for your family without worry. These 3 words are what brings us into this space. </p>
        <h2>The Building Blocks</h2>  
        <ol>
            <li><em>Connection</li></em>
            <li><em>Weatlh</em></li>
            <li><em>Art</em></li>
            <p>These 3 words define the NFT space as a whole and this is what brought us here in the first place.</p>
